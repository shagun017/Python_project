**Quickmart Billing System**

**Description-**
The Quickmart Billing System is a retail billing solution developed using Python's Tkinter for the front-end interface and MySQL Server Workbench for back-end data management. This project includes features for itemized billing, customer data storage, sharing bills via email, printing, and searching bills within the system.
This system addresses the inefficiencies of handwritten bills, which are time-consuming and require meticulous maintenance. With Quickmart Billing System, employees can easily navigate through the system and generate bills in a streamlined manner, eliminating the need for paperwork.

• Employee Login: Secure login credentials for employees responsible for bill generation.

• Paperless Operation: Fully digital, eliminating the need for physical paperwork.

• Simple Design: Intuitive and straightforward interface, making it easy to understand the system's functionality.

• Database Storage: After bill generation, the bill is saved in the customer database along with customer details and bill number in MySQL Workbench.

• Bill Search: Bills can be searched within the system by bill number if needed.

**Usage-**

• Login: Use employee credentials to log in.

• Bill Generation: Go to the bill generation window and enter customer details.
